Virtual Pet Shelter

virtual pet shelter was built out from my testing class and drove the creation of the VirtualPetShelter class and Virtual Pet class. From a  functionality standpoint i decided to use the name as my hashmap key and variables for description, hunger, boredom and, thirst for my values. Users can add a pet to the shelter which currently houses one pet named lucky and can adopt pets out and remove them from the map. There are ways for the user to feed, play or water a pet as well as to do any of these three functions for the entire shelter. All names are converted to lower case to avoid an accidental null value being returned. Also users will receive an error if the pet is not in the shelter and be requested to re-enter a name. I have also used a while loop as a game loop which can be broken by entering "0".My tick method is called with every interaction with a pet(s) and will increase all three values by 1.
